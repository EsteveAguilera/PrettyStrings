# PrettyStrings

PrettyStrings is a small library to give some prettiness to your project strings!

Have you ever worked with an API that gives you strings like: 

**"HOLIDAYS"** or **"holidays"** when you expected something more ready to use like **"Holidays"**?

or an uppercase name like **"JOHN DOE"** when you wanted **"John Doe"**?

We've been in those situations and that's why we developed this small library!

Oh, and we developed it using TDD!

The Sample
----------
Here's a short code to show you how to use it:

```java
String uglyString = "JUST A SAMPLE STRING";

PrettyString prettyString = new PrettyString();

String result = prettyString.capitalizeFirstChar(uglyString); // => "Just a sample string"

String otherResult = prettyString.capitalizeAllFirstChars(uglyString); // => "Just A Sample String"
```
