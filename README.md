# PrettyStrings

A small library to give some prettiness to your project strings!

Have you ever worked with an API that gives you strings like "HOLIDAYS" or "holidays" when you expected something more ready to use like "Holidays"?

The Sample
----------

```java
String uglyString = "JUST A SAMPLE STRING";

PrettyString prettyString = new PrettyString();

String result = prettyString.capitalizeFirstLetter(uglyString); // => "Just a sample string"

String otherResult = prettyString.capitalizeAllFirstLetters(uglyString); // => "Just A Sample String"
```
